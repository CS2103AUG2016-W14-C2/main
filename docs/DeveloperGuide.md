<center><h1> Menion Developer Guide</h1> </center>

# Introduction


[//]: # (@@author A0146752B)

Menion is a simple activity manager for users to track their activities so they can better manage their schedule. It is a command line interface that minimizes mouse usage and focuses on keyboard commands.

This guide will bring you through the design and implementation of Menion. It's purpose is to help you understand how Menion works and how you can further contribute to its development. The content of this guide is structured from a top-down manner to best help you understand how our application works before going into the minute details. Let's begin!

## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. JDK `1.8.0_60`  or later<br>

    > * Having any Java 8 version is not enough. 
    > * This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
2. Eclipse IDE
3. e(fx)clipse plugin for Eclipse 
4. Buildship Gradle Integration plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your computer

2. Open Eclipse

	> * Ensure you have installed the e(fx)clipse and buildship plugins as given in the 		prerequisites above
3. Click `File` > `Import`
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

## Design

### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br> 
> Figure 1: Architecture of the App.<br>

Figure 1 above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[*Main*]() has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/menion/MainApp.java).<br>
It interacts with the different components at 2 specific parts of the App life cycle:

* On app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* On exit: Shuts down the components and saves the activity manager.


[*Commons*](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCentre` : Used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of Event Driven design). (Written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.


The rest of the App consists five components.

* [*`UI`*](#ui-component) : The UI of the App.
* [*`Logic`*](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [*`BackgroundCheck`*]() : Tracks any changes in data when application is running.   
* [*`Model`*](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [*`Storage`*](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the five components:

* Defines its API in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.


<img src="images\SDforDeletePerson.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 2: Sequence diagram for delete command.

Figure 2 above shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete task 1`.

> Notice how the `Model` simply raises a `ActivityManagerChangedEvent` when the Activity Manager data is changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.


<img src="images\SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 3 : Continuation of delete command from Figure 2.

Figure 3 above shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>
> Notice how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` being coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 4: UI component<br>

API : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/menion/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts. 
For example, `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ActivityListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc... All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

`ActivityListPanel` consists of three different activities lists whhich are `taskViewList`, `eventViewList` and `floatingTaskViewList`. Activities in each list is displayed `TaskCard`, `EventCard` and `FloatingTaskCard` respectively.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/menion/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)<br>
 `SceneBuilder` is the main tool that is used to create `.fxml` files.


<img src="images/SDforModifyingStoragePath.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 5: Sequence diagram for modifying storage path<br>

The `UI` component

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component by passing in strings that are captured by `CommandBox`
* binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change
* retrieves the three different lists from `Logic` at the start of the session
* responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly. e.g. `ModifyStoragePathCommand` raise an event that leads to update of storage path in the status bar (refer to diagram 6)

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 6: Storage component<br>

API : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/menion/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component

* saves `UserPref` objects in json format and feeds it back.
* saves the Activity Manager data in xml format and feeds it back.


### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 7: Logic component <br>

API : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/menion/logic/Logic.java)

 [`Logic`](../src/main/java/seedu/menion/logic/Logic.java) uses the `ActivityParser` class to parse the user's command. Some commands such as the `AddCommand` and the `EditCommand` use additional `Parser` classes to help further parse the arguments. They result in a `Command` object being created and executed by the `LogicManager`. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an Activity) and/or raise events. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

<img src="images/DeletePersonSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 8: Sequence Diagram in Logic<br>

Figure 8 is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete task 1")`API call.

<img src="images/addsequencediagram.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 9: Sequence Diagram in Logic for the add command<br>

Figure 9 above shows the additional steps required by the `AddCommand` to parse its arguments. `ActivityParser` class to parse the user's command. The `ActivityParser` uses the `AddParser` class to parse argument for `AddCommand`. After the additional parsing, it creates a `Command` object and continues on in the same steps as the other commands.

[//]: # (@@author A139515A)

Under logic command, there are several commands that make use of `Model` for execution.
`UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand` make use of two stacks in `Model` which stores different states of `ReadOnlyActivityManager`. When there is a command that causes modification to `ReadOnlyActivityManager`, a copy of the state of `ReadOnlyActivityManager` before the modification will be pushed into the undo stack. Calling `UndoCommand` will cause a pop from the undo stack and the state will be pushed into the redo stack. Similarly, calling `RedoCommand` will cause a pop from redo stack and the state will be pushed back into the undo stack. This allows the application to jump around different states of `ReadOnlyActivityManager`.

### BackgroundCheck Component
<img src="images/BackgroundCheck.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 9: BackgroundCheck component<br>

API: `BackgroundCheck.java`

The `BackgroundCheck` component

* Constantly checks the model for any activities which may have their date passed. 
* Updates the model if any activities has passed and stores the updated information into `Storage`.

[//]: # (@@author)

### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 10: Model component<br>

*API* : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/menion/model/Model.java)

> The model class is not coupled to the other three components.


The `Model` component

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Activity Manager data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyActivity>` that can be 'observed' For example, the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
<br><br>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.menion.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

Take note of the following: 

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file

*Logging Levels* can be classified as follows: 

* `SEVERE`: It is a critical problem that may cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : It is a problem which may allow the application to continue to run but do so with caution.
* `INFO` : It is a noteworthy action by the App.
* `FINE` : It may not be noteworthy, but may be useful in debugging.

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`)

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder. There are two available options for tesing.

1. Eclipse
	* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
	* To run a subset of tests, right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

2. Gradle
	* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle



Testing is split into two components:

1. *GUI Tests* - These are System Tests that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
  
2. *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   * Unit tests targeting the lowest level methods/classes. 
      e.g. `seedu.menion.commons.UrlUtilTest`
      <br>
   * Integration tests that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working).
      e.g. `seedu.menion.storage.StorageManagerTest`
      <br>
   * Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together.
      e.g. `seedu.menion.logic.LogicManagerTest`
      <br>
  
>*Headless GUI Testing* :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,our GUI tests can be run in the headless mode.In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
 
#### Troubleshooting tests
 *Problem: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected*
 
 * Reason: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests. 
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. Neon or later)
 * Solution: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described 
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). 
   
Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.
   
## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform Continuous Integration on our projects. See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release:
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) and upload the JAR file your created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Activity Manager depends on the [Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these dependencies can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives.<br>
Remember to include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size). Developers are required to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers).<br>
